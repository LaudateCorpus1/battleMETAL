-------- KEYS -------- 
  .data_idx = <float> [particle id] - the particle effect to spawn
  .c_ofs = <vector> [endpoint] - if effect needs an endpoint, the origin of effect is the map object's origin
  .v_angle = <vector> [speed] -if effect needs a velocity vector
  .count = <float> [particle amount] - total number of particles in the effect
  .p_lifetime = <float> - time to live, use with spawnflags[2]
  .state_1 = <float> - recharge delay - how long to wait before reactivating, use with spawnflags[4]
-------- SPAWNFLAGS -------- 
START_OFF 1 -  - only activated by trigger
LIFETIME 2 - 
REACTIVATE 4 - reactivate after countdown
