A Total-conversion-mod for the DarkPlaces engine all about mecha combat.

I have been coding this since 7/4/2016 based on some initial tests that the Darkplaces Engine might
be robust enough to have an arcadey mech mod. 

This is just a repo for the code, the media assets (models, texture, fx) aren't available yet because
I have not fully decoupled all the original iD assets from the mod.
